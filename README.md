# online-order
Created a fake restaurant called Simple Eats where customers can place their orders and employees can view customer orders. 

Customers use the home page: index.php

Employees use the employee page: employee.php

Note: change the dbh.inc.php file to connect to your database with your servername, username, password, and database name. The SQL file provided can be used once the database has been created to create the necessary tables and inserts for the Food items and the Employees.
